## Technology Stack
Falcon (via Hugging Face): The core model for natural language generation, used to create tailored cover letters and resumes.
AutoTokenizer (Hugging Face): Processes input data and converts it into tokens that the Falcon model can understand.
PyTorch: Powers the machine learning framework used for model loading and text generation.
Gradio: Provides an interactive user interface to input data and view the AI-generated results.
Docker: Containerizes the application for easy deployment and environment consistency.
Model Details
Model: Falcon, a, open-source language model from TII, optimized for generating human-like text.
Text Generation: The Falcon model generates coherent cover letters using causal language modeling, ensuring that each word and phrase is contextually relevant to the user’s inputs.
Custom Parameters: The model uses parameters such as temperature (set to 0.7 for balanced creativity) and max_length to generate optimal cover letter outputs.
Results
Efficient: Reduces time spent on creating resumes and cover letters by automating the generation process.
High-Quality Outputs: Generated content is contextually relevant, personalized, and professional.
User-Friendly: The tool’s intuitive interface allows users of all technical levels to easily generate and refine documents.

##Future Enhancements
