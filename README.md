## How It Works

This tool leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 and advanced prompt engineering techniques to produce highly customized career documents:

Input Details: The user provides basic information like job title, key skills, and work experience.

Custom Prompts: Based on this input, pre-trained prompts are used to generate draft resumes and cover letters, optimized for relevance and readability.

Refinement: Users can refine or customize sections, allowing for greater personalization.



## Technology Stack

Foundation Models: Built on OpenAI's GPT-3 for powerful, natural language generation.

Hugging Face Transformers: Used to experiment with model training and fine-tuning.

PyTorch: For experimenting with foundation model adjustments.

Flask/Streamlit: A simple web interface that allows users to interact with the model seamlessly.

LangChain: Employed to structure prompt engineering and chain reasoning for personalized responses.

Docker: To containerize the application for easy deployment and testing.


## Model Training Details

Data Sources: The foundational model was fine-tuned on a dataset containing a mix of generic resumes, industry-specific samples, and cover letters from various job sectors.

Prompt Engineering: Techniques such as zero-shot and few-shot prompting were used to guide the model towards high-quality output.

Fine-Tuning: Leveraged Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune GPT-3 specifically for career-oriented language, making it capable of adapting to various roles like engineering, marketing, and management.

Evaluation and Results

Precision: High accuracy in extracting key elements from user input.

User Feedback: During testing, the model was found to reduce time spent on resume building by up to 70%.
